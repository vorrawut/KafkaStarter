- A serializer is just the oppositeâ€”you give it an object, and it returns an array of bytes:


Serialization is important for Kafka because as mentioned above, a Kafka broker only works with bytes. 
Kafka stores records in bytes, and when a fetch request comes in from a consumer, Kafka returns records in bytes. 

The broker really knows nothing about its records.
it just appends them to the end of a file, and that's the end of it.
